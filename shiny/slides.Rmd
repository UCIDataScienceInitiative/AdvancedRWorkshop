## What is it
+ "web application framework for R"
+ turns R code into interactive webpages
+ easy
+ flexible
+ fun
+ useful?!

---

## Goals for today
+ run first app
+ cover tutorial topics
+ mention more advanced topics
+ interested in adminstering a UCI Shiny server? Ping me!

---

## Approximate schedule
+ basic concepts
+ layouts & UI
+ server
+ develop a simple example app
+ exercise 1 (15min): your turn to make a simple app
+ reactivity
+ extensions
+ sharing & deployment
+ exercise 2 (until lunch): something a little more complicated

---

## UI and server

+ 2 files; reasonable but not necessary
+ UI
  + define form elements for user input
  + specify where to put output from R
+ server
  + take input from user
  + ???
  + return output, e.g. plots, tables, etc


--- 
## UI & layout

Skeletal version:
```
shinyUI(fluidPage(
))
```

Sidebar layout with text:
```
shinyUI(fluidPage(
  titlePanel("This is the title of the page"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel("This text will be shown in the sidebar"),
    mainPanel("This text goes in the main part of the page")
  )
))
```

---

## sidebarLayout: good enough

Shiny gives you plenty of control over layout. Today we'll stick with `sidebarLayout`.

Besides the builtin helpers, it's possible to layout HTML elements directly.

---

## Webpages of text are boring
2 key ingredients: _inputs_ and _outputs_.

Inputs are form elements for the user. You assign variable names to the user's  input. Shiny will provide those inputs as arguments to the server. Examples:
+ `selectInput` is a drop down box, user can select from a list.
+ `sliderInput` is a slider, user selects a number within a range.


Outputs show R return values. The R code simply returns a list with named elements. Examples:
+ `textOutput` for when R returns text.
+ `plotOutput` for plots (!).
+ `dataTableOutput` for tables.

---

## Adding an input to the layout

```
shinyUI(fluidPage(
  titlePanel("This is the title of the page"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel("This text will be shown in the sidebar",
                 sliderInput("n_samples", 
                             label = "Number of samples:",
                             min = 1, max = 100, value = c(50))
    ),
    mainPanel("This text goes in the main part of the page",
              textOutput("summaries"), plotOutput("samplePlot"))
  )
))
```

---
## Server
The user's input is stored in `input$n_samples` - this is because the first argument to `sliderInput` was `"n_samples"`! The server doesn't care what input it came from.

```
shinyServer(
  function(input, output) {
    output$summaries <- renderText(paste("n:", input$n_samples))
    output$samplePlot <- renderPlot(hist(rnorm(input$n_samples)))
  }
)
```

---
## How the server code is executed
3 different cases!

```
# Case 1: run once, when app is launched

shinyServer(
  function(input, output) {
    # Case 2: run every time a user loads the app page
    output$summaries <- renderText(paste("n:", input$n_samples))
    output$samplePlot <- renderPlot(hist(rnorm(input$n_samples)))
  }
)
```
The 3rd case isn't really covered today.

---
## Look at an example running app

Navigate your web browser to

```
http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/faithful.html
```

---
## Many ways of launching an app
Let's say you have a shiny app on your local file storage.

+ R's command prompt, using the funciton `runApp`
+ the terminal, `R -e "shiny::runApp('~/shinyapp')"`
+ from RStudio, using the "Run App" in the top-right corner of the source panel. Rstudio seems to detect when the R file is for a shiny app.

Shiny automatically re-loads on source file changes!... but only for `ui.r` and `server.r`.

---
## Try running the hello world app!

Download the repo [1] from GitHub, and open the `shiny/hello_world/ui.r` and `shiny/hello_world/server.r` files in RStudio. Then click on "Run App", or execute

```
runApp('/change/this/path/AdvancedRWorkshop/shiny/hello_world')
```

---
## Exercises

+ adding other controls
  + changing the mean
  + chaning the standard deviation
+ try switching to a "tabset" layout, with a separate tab for the summary stats (instead of having the summary stats in the same main panel as the graphic)
+ add a drop-down menu which can change the distribution

---
## A few words about how this works
+ the web depends on client-server architecture
+ the idea is that many clients can connect to a single server
+ the "server" can be your own laptop, or it could a computer in the basement, or a cloud server hosted by Amazon.
+ client = the browser (for us).
+ the browser handles the layout and the human interaction
+ shiny provides code for _both_ the client and the server.
+ when the client and the server are communicating, they are basically sending back and forth R lists.
+ the variety different languages/technologies is a big challenge in web development

---
## More toys
 + `renderTable` / `tableOutput` for simple tables
 + `renderText` / `verbatimTextOutput` for formattted R output
 + `renderPlot` / `renderPlot` for plots (ggplot2 works fine!)


---
## 1 layout tip: Tab Sets
In our previous example, we had the following main panel.

```
mainPanel("This text goes in the main part of the page",
          textOutput("summaries"), plotOutput("samplePlot"))
```

If we have different types of output (e.g. plot, table, model output, etc) we can put each in a "Tab Set", which goes in the main panel, like this:

```
mainPanel(
    tabsetPanel(
      tabPanel("Plot", plotOutput("diamond.plot")), 
      tabPanel("Summary", textOutput("summaries")) 
    )
)
```

---
## Tables

 + `renderTable` / `tableOutput` for simple tables
 vs.
 + `renderDataTable` / `dataTableOutput` for ~fancy~ tables 

Data tables features include sorting, filtering, and paging. Named after the JavaScript library, DataTable, which is used to create the tables in the browser.

Simple tables are fine for e.g. `head(my.data.frame)`, but generally DataTables are preferred because they are so much more flexible, and just as easy to include in your app.

---
## Debugging Shiny apps

+ printing intput variables can only be done inside a reactive context.
+ `browser` is often much more useful
  + allows you to explore variables at any particular point in code
  + "breakpoint"
  + use `Q` to escape the `browser` environment
+ (you can also use `browser` at any time!)

---
## Advanced browsing

### Conditional browsing

Only trigger the browser when the user enters a certain input

+ Only enter browser if the `price` input is greater than 2000:
+ `browser(expr=input$price > 2000)`

### Custom error handling
This is also generally useful. Automatically enter browser on any error:

```
options(error = browser)
```

---
## DESCRIPTION

+ useful metadata for distribution
+ also a way to enable `Showcase` mode

```

## So, to share an app...
It depends on whether your audience can run it from R.

### From R
+ `runApp`: local files
+ `runUrl`: downloadable files over the internet
+ `runGitHub`: apps whose source is on GitHub
+ `runGist`: apps whose source is in a Gist

### Not from R
+ it must be on a server which can be reached by your audience.
+ Shinyapps.io $$$
+ Shiny Server (if anybody is interested in helping to help setup)

---
## Sharing

If the app is on GitHub, then it's easy to start it locally using the `runGitHub` function. e.g.

```
runGitHub("AdvancedRWorkshop", "UCIDataScienceInitiative", subdir="shiny/hello_world")
```

`runGist` is a similar function for running apps whose source is stored in gists.

## Very important stuff
... that is not covered today, but is interesting.

+ can store/query data using databases, dropbox, AWS S3, etc
+ plugins exist for mapping, 3D scatterplots, networks, various D3 charts.
+ reactivity is for optimizing the server computation to re-use as much as possible
+ Shiny apps can be defined in RMarkdown reports to produce "interactive documents"
+ it's easy to allow users to download data, e.g. data frames as CSV files
+ layout is completely customizable
+ seems like there's some support for interactive plots(!)

---
## Example use cases
+ exploring a new data set
+ making an interface for humans to label data
+ getting points on hacker news
+ creating dashboards that monitor real-time data
+ make friends and influencing others
+ educational tools

---
## Resources

The official documentation from RStudio is pretty good. A few pointers:
+ The cheatsheet is a great summary
  + http://shiny.rstudio.com/images/shiny-cheatsheet.pdf
+ The gallery has lots of useful examples of complete apps
  + http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/
+ the widget gallery isolated uses for all of the builtin widgets
  + http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/widget-gallery.html
+ non-Rstudio gallery
  + http://www.showmeshiny.com/
  + and companion twitter, @showmeshiny

## Exercise 2
+ For this exercise, you are invited to do _whatever_ you want with Shiny.
+ Suggested exercise: build, from scratch, an app that will explore the `diamonds` dataset of ggplot2 fame.
+ controls: scale, with 2 knobs, for subsetting the data
+ the server should subset the data accordingly and return a plot of the data over that subset
+ then add a checkbox for making the dots transparent
