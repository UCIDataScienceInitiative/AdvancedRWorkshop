## What is it
+ "web application framework for R"
+ turns R code into interactive webpages
+ easy
+ flexible
+ fun
+ useful?!

---

## Goals for today
+ run first app
+ cover tutorial topics
+ mention more advanced topics
+ interested in adminstering a UCI Shiny server? Ping me!

---

## Approximate schedule
+ basic concepts
+ layouts & UI
+ server
+ develop a simple example app
+ exercise 1 (15min): your turn to make a simple app
+ reactivity
+ extensions
+ sharing & deployment
+ exercise 2 (until lunch): something a little more complicated

---

## UI and server

+ 2 files; reasonable but not necessary
+ UI
  + define form elements for user input
  + specify where to put output from R
+ server
  + take input from user
  + ???
  + return output, e.g. plots, tables, etc

## UI & layout

Skeletal version:
```
shinyUI(fluidPage(
))
```

Sidebar layout with text:
```
shinyUI(fluidPage(
  titlePanel("This is the title of the page"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel("This text will be shown in the sidebar"),
    mainPanel("This text goes in the main part of the page")
  )
))
```

## sidebarLayout: good enough

Shiny gives you plenty of control over layout. Today we'll stick with `sidebarLayout`.

---

## Webpages of text are boring
2 key ingredients: _inputs_ and _outputs_.

Inputs are form elements for the user. You assign variable names to the user's  input. Shiny will provide those inputs as arguments to the server. Examples:
+ `selectInput` is a drop down box, user can select from a list.
+ `sliderInput` is a slider, user selects a number within a range.


Outputs show R return values. The R code simply returns a list with named elements. Examples:
+ `textOutput` for when R returns text.
+ `plotOutput` for plots (!).
+ `dataTableOutput` for tables.

---

## Adding an input to the layout

```
shinyUI(fluidPage(
  titlePanel("This is the title of the page"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel("This text will be shown in the sidebar",
                 sliderInput("n_samples", 
                             label = "Number of samples:",
                             min = 1, max = 100, value = c(50))
    ),
    mainPanel("This text goes in the main part of the page", textOutput("summaries"), plotOutput("samplePlot"))
  )
))
```
