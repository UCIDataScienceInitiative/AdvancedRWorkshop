There are $n$ samples. How does the distribution change as there are more samples?


```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
sliderInput("n_samples", label = "Number of samples:",
              min=2, max=100, value = 50)

sliderInput("mean", label = "Mean:",
              min=-10, max=10, value = 0)
```

The sample mean is an unbiased estimator because $E(\bar{x})=\mu$. When the mean changes, the histogram should also change.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
re <- reactive({
  rnorm(input$n_samples, mean=input$mean)
})

renderPlot({
  qplot(re())
})
```
The sample mean is $E(\bar{x})$=`r renderText({ mean(re()) })`.
